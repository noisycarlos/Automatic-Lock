Main Module is 'auto_lock.py'

To Launch the Python script when the Raspberry Pi starts, I followed this tutorial:
https://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-Launch-Python-script-on-startup/

Additional Dependencies Installed:
pyjwt (just enter the next line into Raspberry Pi) command line:
pip install pyjwt

If you get an error, because you don't have PIP, try this first:
sudo apt-get install python-pip
